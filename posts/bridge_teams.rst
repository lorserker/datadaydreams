How We Became National Champions
================================

This year, in the Slovenian Open Teams Championships, I had the pleasure to be part of the winning team, together with Bogdan Rasula, Joze Sadar, Janko Mijoc and Gregor Rus.

   The winning team: Joze, Janko, Bogdan, Lorand and Gregor

After struggling in the qualifiers, we made it into the playoffs by a hairsbredth of 0.14 victory points.
The semifinals were highly dramatic. We managed to turn around a huge handicap and win the match by 1 IMP after scoring 46 IMPs in the last four deals.

The finals were extremely tight, but bringing the high morale, solid play, and a bit of luck, we managed to run away with the title defeating the Slovenian dream team who has won so often in the past that nobody keeps count anymore.

If I had to pick one most interesting board that I played, it would be following. With three deals to go, I picked up this hand as North:

	<p>East opened a precicion 2&clubs;, my partner doubled, West passed, and I bid 4&spades;.</p>

	<p>On the lead of the &clubs;K a lot of things were going through my head as I was trying to make a game contract which could well prove to be decisive. It looks like I have to lose one spade, one heart and a club, and should avoid a diamond loser somehow. From the bidding probably East has the <span style="color: red;">&hearts;</span>A and <span style="color: red;">&diams;</span>K, but it won't help me to play a diamond towards the qeen, the thrumps should also be 3-2, and I would rather West have three... but still the pieces of the puzzle were not quite fitting.</p>

	<p>Anyway, I decided to take the lead with the A, play two top spades and a heart, hoping for the best. Now my opponent could make a mistake taking his <span style="color: red;">&hearts;</span>A immediately. Indeed, my opponent fell into a long pause, but eventually he made the correct play of a small heart. Taking in dummy, I saw that things aren't looking good. So I decided to change plans and play a club to my Jack. I figured that I'll be able to ruff the losing club and still survive somehow if the opponents lead into my diamonds from the wrong side. West took the &clubs;J with the Q and continued clubs, I ruffed, overruffed by East, Jack of diamonds, one down!<br/>
	Some of the spectators pointed out the slightly better line of continuing with the hearts after West ducking the first; when taking the <span style="color: red;">&hearts;</span>A West would have to play clubs and East would have to be very careful not to ruff with his Queen.</p>

	<p>In retrospect, my only chance to make the game on perfect defence is to play East for the QJx of trumps and run a spade to my ten at trick two. Fortunately, although I missed the correct play, this board did not cost us the victory.</p>
